Replace the `x` and/or `y` aesthetics with other variables from the dataset, run the chunk, and observe what you get. You might get a reasonable plot, or an error. If you get an error, try another variable. Here is a list of the variables in the data frame. Discuss why certain variables make sense to represent with points and others don't.

```{r var-names}
names(starwars)
```

```{r scatterplot}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```
