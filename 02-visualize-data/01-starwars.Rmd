The following is a list of the variables in the `starwars` dataset:

```{r var-names}
names(starwars)
```

1. Modify the code below to plot height vs. birth_year. See the help for the data frame for the definition of `birth_year` in this context.

```{r height-birth-year}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. You should observe that a few observations appear to be outliers. Can you guess who those characters are? Hint: Run `View(starwars)` in the Console to take a look at the raw data.

3. Stretch goal: Visualise the relationship between height and sex using a scatterplot (`geom_point()`). Describe any features of the data that this visualisation reveals.

```{r height-sex}
# add code here
```
