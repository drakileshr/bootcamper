title: "Instructional staff trends"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```

The code below brings you to the point in the slides where we left off...

```{r}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))
```

#### Exercise 1.

Recreate the line plot from the slides, and make sure the figure width is large 
enough to make it legible. Also fix the title, axis labels, and legend label.

```{r line-plot}
# add your code here
```

#### Exercise 2.

Suppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of 
part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional 
staff types. What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this 
story. Implement those changes below.

```{r better-line}
# add your code here
```
