```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
continents <- read_csv("data/continents.csv")
```

The code below brings you to the point in the slides where we left off...

```{r catch-up}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  filter(total > 100000) %>%
  left_join(continents) %>%
  mutate(
    continent = case_when(
      country == "Democratic Republic of the Congo" ~ "Africa",
      country == "Hong Kong"                        ~ "Asia",
      country == "Myanmar"                          ~ "Asia",
      TRUE                                          ~ continent
      ),
    aquaculture_perc = aquaculture / total
    )
```

**Note:** In each of these exercises you will need to set `eval=TRUE` when you're 
ready to run the code for that exercise.

1. Calculate the mean aquaculture percentage (we'll call it `mean_ap` for short) 
for counties in the fisheries data using the `summarise()` function in dplyr. 
Note that the function for calculating the mean is `mean()` in R.

```{r fisheries-mean, eval=FALSE}
fisheries %>%                  # start with the fisheries data frame
  ___(mean_ap = ___)           # calculate mean aquaculture
```

2. Now expand your calculations to also calculate the minimum and maximum 
aquaculture percentage for countries in the fisheries data. Note that the 
functions for calculating minimum and maximum in R are `min()` and `max()`
respectively.

```{r fisheries-summary, eval=FALSE}
fisheries %>%                  # start with the fisheries data frame
  # and the rest of the code goes here         
```

3. Create a new data frame called `fisheries_summary_continent` that calculates 
minimum, mean, and maximum aquaculture percentage for each continent in the 
fisheries data. 

```{r fisheries-summary-continent, eval=FALSE}
fisheries_summary_continent <- fisheries %>%
  ___ %>%                      # ensure calculations are done per continent
  # you can reuse code from Exercise 2 here                        
```

4. Take the `fisheries_summary_continent` data frame and order the results in descending 
order of mean aquaculture percentage.

```{r fisheries-summary-continent-sorted, eval=FALSE}
fisheries_summary_continent %>%      # start with the fisheries_summary_continent data frame
  ___                                # order in descending order of mean_ap
```
