**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.

# Instructional staff employment trends

---

The American Association of 
University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty 
and other academic professionals. 
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) 
by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 
and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/staff-employment.png")
```

---

## Data

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the 
years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type 
of faculty for each year.

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
staff
```

---

## Recreate the visualization

In order to recreate this visualization we need to first reshape the data to have 
one variable for faculty type and one variable for year. In other words, 
we will convert the data from the long format to wide format. 

But before we do so... 

.question[
If the long data will have a row for each year/faculty type combination, 
and there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will the data have?
]

## `pivot_*()` functions


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyr-longer-wider.gif")
```

---

## `pivot_longer()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
pivot_longer(data, cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value")
```

- The first argument is `data` as usual.
- The second argument, `cols`, is where you specify which columns to pivot 
into longer format -- in this case all columns except for the `faculty_type` 
- The third argument, `names_to`, is a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names of data -- in this case `year`
- The fourth argument, `values_to`, is a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in cell values, in this case `percentage`

---

## Pivot staff data

```{r}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year", values_to = "percentage") %>%
  mutate(percentage = as.numeric(percentage))

staff_long
```

---

.question[
This doesn't look quite right, how would you fix it?
]

.small[
```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  coord_flip()
```
]

---

.small[
```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  coord_flip()
```
]

---

## Some improvement...

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

---

## More improvement

```{r fig.width=7}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, group = faculty_type, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```

## `r emo::ji("computer")` Your turn

- Go to RStudio Cloud and start the second assignment: `04 - Tidy Data`
- Open the first R Markdown file: `01-instructional-staff.Rmd`
- Knit the document, and work on the exercises

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)
