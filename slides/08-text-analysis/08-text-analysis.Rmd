# Text analysis

---

## Text analysis

- Text mining (text analysis) is the process of deriving high-quality information from text.
- Typical text mining tasks include 
  - text categorization
  - text clustering
  - concept/entity extraction
  - production of granular taxonomies
  - sentiment analysis
  - document summarization
  - entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities)

---

## Tidytext

- Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools we've already learned about
- **Tidy text** = one-**token**-per-row
  - A token can be a word or an n-gram (e.g. bigram = 2 words) 
- Learn more at [tidytextmining.com](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

## What is tidy text?

```{r}
text <- c("Take me out tonight",
          "Where there's music and there's people",
          "And they're young and alive",
          "Driving in your car",
          "I never never want to go home",
          "Because I haven't got one",
          "Anymore")

text
```

## What is tidy text?

```{r}
text_df <- tibble(line = 1:7, text = text)

## Let's get more data

We'll use the `genius` package to get song lyric data from [Genius](https://genius.com/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(genius) # https://github.com/JosiahParry/genius
```

- `genius_album()` allows you to download the lyrics for an entire album in a 
tidy format. 
- Input: Two arguments artists and album. Supply the quoted name of artist 
and the album (if it gives you issues check that you have the album name and 
artists as specified on [Genius](https://genius.com/)).
- Output: A tidy data frame with three columns:
    - `title`: track name
    - `track_n`: track number
    - `text`: lyrics

---

## Hamilton!

```{r cache=TRUE}
hamilton <- genius_album(
  artist = "Lin-Manuel Miranda", 
  album = "Hamilton: An American Musical (Off-Broadway)"
  )
glimpse(hamilton)
```

---

## Save for later

```{r}
hamilton <- hamilton %>%
  mutate(
    album = "Hamilton",
    artist = "Lin-Manuel Miranda"
    )
```

---

## How many songs are in the album?

```{r}
hamilton %>%
  distinct(track_title) %>%
  nrow()
```

---

## How long are Hamilton songs?

Length measured by number of lines

```{r}
hamilton %>%
  count(track_title) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  select(n, track_title)
```

---

## Tidy up your lyrics!

.small[
```{r}
hamilton_lyrics <- hamilton %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric)

hamilton_lyrics
```
]

---

## What are the most common words?

```{r}
hamilton_lyrics %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

---

## Stop words

- **Stop words** are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text)
- They usually refer to the most common words in a language, but there is not a single list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools

---

## Spanish stop words

```{r}
get_stopwords(language = "es")
```

---

## Various lexicons

See `?get_stopwords` for more info.

```{r}
get_stopwords(source = "smart")
```

---

## What are the most common words?

```{r}
hamilton_lyrics %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(source = "smart")) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.25}
hamilton_lyrics %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(source = "smart")) %>%

  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%

    labs(title = "Frequency of Hamilton lyrics",
         subtitle = "Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da",
         y = "",
         x = "")
```

## Sentiment analysis

- One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a combination of its individual words 
- and the sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words

---

## Sentiment lexicons

.pull-left[
```{r}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
get_sentiments("bing") 
```
]

---

## Sentiments in Hamilton lyrics

```{r}
hamilton_lyrics %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(sentiment, word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

---

## Visualizing sentiments

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
hamilton_lyrics %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(sentiment, word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(word, n), n, fill = sentiment)) +
    geom_col() +
    coord_flip() +
    facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Sentiments in Hamilton lyrics",

# Comparing lyrics across artists

## Get more data

Get data from two more artists:

.midi[
```{r eval=FALSE}
american_teen <- genius_album(artist = "Khalid", album = "American Teen") %>%
  mutate(artist = "Khalid", album = "American Teen")
sinister <- genius_album(artist = "Belle and Sebastian", album = "If You're Feeling Sinister") %>%
  mutate(artist = "Belle and Sebastian", album = "If You're Feeling Sinister")
drones <- genius_album(artist = "Muse", album = "Drones") %>%
  mutate(artist = "Muse", album = "Drones")
```
]

```{r include=FALSE}
american_teen <- read_rds("data/american_teen.rds")
sinister      <- read_rds("data/sinister.rds")
drones        <- read_rds("data/drones.rds")
```

---

## Combine data

.pull-left[
```{r}
mixtape <- bind_rows(
  hamilton, 
  american_teen, 
  sinister, 
  drones
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
![](img/mixtape.png)
]

```{r}
glimpse(mixtape)
```

---

## All lyrics

.small[
```{r}
mixtape_lyrics <- mixtape %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric)

mixtape_lyrics
```
]

---

## Common lyrics

Without stop words:

```{r}
mixtape_lyrics_counts <- mixtape_lyrics %>%
  anti_join(get_stopwords(source = "smart")) %>%
  filter(
    # stop words that weren't in the lexicon
    !(word %in% c("da", "dadadadada", "la", "ooh", "em"))
    ) %>%
  count(artist, word, sort = TRUE) # alternative way to sort
```

---

## What is a document about?

- Term frequency
- Inverse document frequency

$$idf(\text{term}) = \ln{\left(\frac{n_{\text{documents}}}{n_{\text{documents containing term}}}\right)}$$

tf-idf is about comparing **documents** within a **collection**.

---

## Calculating tf-idf

This is not that exciting... What's the issue?

```{r}
mixtape_words <- mixtape_lyrics_counts %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, artist, n)

mixtape_words
```

---

## Sorting tf-idf

```{r}
mixtape_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, artist, n) %>%
  arrange(-tf_idf)
```

---

## 

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6, fig.retina=3}
mixtape_words %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(word, tf_idf), tf_idf, fill = artist)) + 
    geom_col(alpha = 0.9, show.legend = FALSE) + coord_flip() + 
    facet_wrap(~artist, ncol=2, scales = "free") + 
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf")
```
