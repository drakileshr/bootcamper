# Text Books


---
# Metacognitive strategies
- Fancy term for "thinking about cognitive skills"
---

# Activity
- All odd numbered persons turn around
- Even number persons continue to watch the screen carefully
<video>
---

# All turn back
- Odd numbered people answer the question on your screen (Even numbered people please wait)
--
- Even numbered people answer the question on your screen
--
- Use two modes of content delivery 
  - Audio + visual.
      - Visual can be text or image or both
      - When using both, they must NOT repeat
  - Audio must not repeat "ditto" what is on the screen

# Lazy Teaching
- What is better?
  - 80 % portion covered in class & student studying 50% of taught lessons ?
  - 50% coverage and student gaining 80% of your taught lessons ?
--
- Some difficulty is GOOD for learning for all students
- MORE difficult is BETTER for learning for some students
- MOST difficult is BEST for learning, but only a few manage

# Being inclusive and equitable
- Three levels of lesson objectives in your objectives
  - An ideal expected learning goal *Ideal*
--
  - A bare minimum learning goal (for those on the edge of learning & not learning) *Expected*
--
  - A bar above the ideal (for those exemplar students) *Optional*
