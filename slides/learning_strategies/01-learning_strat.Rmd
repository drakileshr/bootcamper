# Lazy Teaching

- What is better?
  - 80 % portion covered in class & student studying 50% of taught lessons ?
  - 50% coverage and student gaining 80% of your taught lessons ?
---

# Insight into "learning"

- Some difficulty is GOOD for learning for all students
- MORE difficult is BETTER for learning for some students
- MOST difficult is BEST for learning, but only a few manage

---

# Being inclusive and equitable

- Three levels of lesson objectives in your objectives

--
  - An ideal expected learning goal *Ideal*

--
  - A bare minimum learning goal (for those on the edge of learning & not learning) *Expected*

--
  - A bar above the ideal (for those exemplar students) *Optional*
