## Metacognitive strategies

- "Thinking about thinking"
--
- Probing into "why's" they are learning
- Awareness of how & what they are learning
--
- An evaluation of individual learning needs
- Generating strategies to meet the needs
- Implementing the strategies
--
- Monitoring, evaluating and modifying dynamically and contextually

---
class:doublespace

## Why metacognitive strategies?

- Learners show **self-confidence**
- Crucial for independent learning
- **Self-efficacy** improves.
- Fosters **forethought & self-reflection**
- All these fosters self-regulated learning

## Insight into "learning"

- Some difficulty is GOOD for learning for all students
- MORE difficult is BETTER for learning for some students
- MOST difficult is BEST for learning, but only a few manage

## Being inclusive and equitable

- Three levels of lesson objectives in your objectives

--
  - An ideal expected learning goal *Ideal*

--
  - A bare minimum learning goal (for those on the edge of learning & not learning) *Expected*

--
  - A bar above the ideal (for those exemplar students) *Optional*
