## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2 
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

## `r emo::ji("computer")` Your turn

- Go to RStudio Cloud and start the second assignment: `02 - Visualize Data`
- Open the first R Markdown file: `01-starwars.Rmd`
- Replace the `x` and/or `y` aesthetics with other variables from the dataset, 
run the chunk, and observe what you get. You might get a reasonable plot, or 
an error. If you get an error, try another variable.

```{r echo=FALSE}

## Additional variables

We can map additional variables to various features of the plot:

- aesthetics
    - shape
    - colour
    - fill
    - size
    - alpha (transparency)
- faceting: small multiples displaying different subsets

# Aesthetics

---

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable**
in the data are

- `color`
- `size`
- `fill`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's now increase the size of all points *not* based on the values of a 
variable in the data, i.e. **set** size instead of **map** size:

.midi[
```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) #<<
```
]

---

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous
------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | *shouldn't (and doesn't) work*

- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable, define the 
features in the geom for customization **not** mapped to a variable

# Faceting

---

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

---

```{r fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "Faceted by gender")  #<<
```

The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. 
because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots. But you 
should always label your plots!

ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +

## Facet summary

- `facet_grid()`: 
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d

# Identifying variables

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering. R uses the term 
**factor** for most categorical data.

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

* shape:
    * skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    * modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
* center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
* spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
* unusal observations
