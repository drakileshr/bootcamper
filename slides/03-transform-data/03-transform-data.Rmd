# Data wrangling and summarizing 
# with **dplyr**

---

## A grammar of data wrangling...

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = "center", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- ... (many more)
]
]

---

## Rules of **dplyr** functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame
- Don't modify in place

# Pipes

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

--

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% #<<
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`, and pass it to the `select()` function,

  arrange(bike_age)

---

## Aside

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**, though we don't need to load this package explicitly since **tidyverse** does this for us.

<br>

--

.question[
Any guesses as to why the package is called magrittr?
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r magritte, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", caption = "Magritte's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magritte.jpg")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r magrittr, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", caption = "magrittr's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magrittr.jpg")
```
]

---

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```
- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

## What about other arguments?

Use the dot to

- send results to a function argument other than first one or 
- use the previous result for multiple arguments

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .) #<<
```

---

## A note on piping and layering

- The `%>%` operator in **dplyr** functions is called the pipe operator. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.
- The `+` operator in **ggplot2** functions is used for "layering". This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`.
- Many of the styling principles are consistent across `%>%` and `+`:
  - always a space before
  - always a line break after (for pipelines with more than 2 lines)

# Data wrangling with dplyr

---

## `select` to keep variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(locality, speed_limit) #<<
```

---

## `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(-object_id) #<<
```

---

## `select` a range of variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(city:locality) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}

  select(starts_with("bike_")) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}

  select(ends_with("age")) #<<
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `arrange` in ascending / descending order

.pull-left[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(bike_age) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(desc(bike_age)) #<<
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

First five

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five
 
```{r}
last_row <- nrow(ncbikecrash)
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row) #<<
```

---

## `filter` to select a subset of rows

Crashes in Durham County

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham") #<<
```

---

## `filter` for many conditions at once

Crashes in Durham County where biker is 0-5 years old

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter( #<<
    county == "Durham",     #<<
    bike_age_group == "0-5" #<<
    ) #<<

# Fisheries

---

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. The (not-so-great) visualization belows shows the distribution of fishery harvest 
of countries for 2016, by capture and aquaculture.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fisheries.png")
```

.footnote[
- Countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons are not 
included in the visualization.
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country
]

---

.question[
What are some ways you would improve this visualization?
]

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fisheries.png")
```

--

- Calculate summary statistics at the continent level and visualize them.
- Map the data.

---

## Data prep

```{r include=FALSE}
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
continents <- read_csv("data/continents.csv")
```

Filter out countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons since they 
are not included in the visualization:

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  filter(total > 100000)

fisheries

# Data joins

---

.pull-left[
```{r}
fisheries %>% select(country)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
continents
```
]

---

## Joining data frames

```
*_join(x, y)
```

- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches
- `left_join()`: all rows from x
- `right_join()`: all rows from y
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y
- `semi_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
- `anti_join()`: return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x
- ...

# Mapping

## Mapping the fisheries data

- Join the fisheries and country boundaries data frames
- Plot the country boundaries, and fill by fisheries harvest data
