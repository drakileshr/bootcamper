## `r emo::ji("computer")` Your turn

- Go to [rstd.io/bootcamper-cloud](https://rstd.io/bootcamper-cloud) and join the 
RStudio Cloud workspace for the bootcamp.
- Start the first assignment: `01 - Whole game`
- Open `01-unvotes-rmd.Rmd` and knit the document.
- Change "Turkey" to another country and knit again. Compare with breakout room-mates(?)
how the country you chose voted on certain issues.

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---

## `r emo::ji("computer")` Demo

Continue to work in the first assignment: `01 - Whole game`

- Open `02-unvotes-rmd-param.Rmd` and knit the document.
- Open `03-unvotes-shiny.Rmd` and knit the document.

# R

---

## R

- R can be used as a calculator.
```{r}
8738787213 / 1653
```


- The most commonly used data type in R is data frames, where each row represents 
an observation, and each column a variable.

```{r}
mtcars
```

---

## R

- We use the `$` operator to access a variable within a data frame.

```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```

- Functions are (often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses.

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

---

## R

- In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package.
- As of September 2019, there are over 14,000 packages available on the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN), the public clearing house for R packages. 
- This huge variety of packages is one reason why R is so successful: the chances are that someone has already solved a problem that you’re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their package.
- Using R packages:
  - Install them from CRAN with `install.packages("x")`
  - Use them in R with `library(x)`
  - Get help on them with package `?x` and `help(package = "x")`

## R Markdown

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown-anatomy.png")
```

---

## R Markdown tips

- Most importantly: environment of your R Markdown document is separate from that of the Console
- Help:
  - [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) 
  - Markdown Quick Reference (Help -> Markdown Quick Reference)

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every "your turn" exercise is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the bootcamp
